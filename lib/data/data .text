      'The ant card comes to you as a reminder of the importance of being involved with community.You need to work with others and establish good fellowship to have peaceful conformity and live in an orderly coexistence. Get disciplined and start planning. You\'re about to learn more about teamwork, and self-sacrifice.',
      'Remember to allow others to add to the work ahead. To do this, you need to step aside and learn to designate some duties and errands to others. This isn\'t a time to be a boss or to take over. It\'s time to get organized and start passing on different tasks to others to get the job done. It\'s about productivity and discipline, not about glory or fame. A good designator knows that there\'s always a task one person loves more than others. So, help others find their place. One that suits them, not you.',
      'You may have to step aside from your old position and make way for new and fresh minds to get things done. Ants can teach us many things about personal goals and the importance of teamwork. They represent strength, diligence, willpower, honesty, unity, patience, determination, stamina, sacrifice, and loyalty. These are just some of their amazing attributes that you share.',
      'The ant is a fierce animal spirit guide and protector. Despite its tiny size, it possesses an immense strength. There\'s nothing it can\'t accomplish. This is a reminder that some things don\'t come easy without putting effort into it first. If that means doing less for the sake of everyone\'s self esteem, then do so. Step aside for everyone\'s behalf and allow everyone a chance to feel that they\'re important members of the team. The effort of the team is the biggest and most important accomplishment that you can obtain.'

As bats are blind and deaf, they rely on sonar to be able to navigate their way into the night. The bat is one of the animals we connect to mystery and darkness. Not everything we have been taught by others is entirely true. Make no judgements and get to know others and situations before you join in on banter or take sides.',

If you run into the bear, you\'ll know quickly that within his territory, you\'ll respect and abide by his laws and boundaries. That or things are going to get messy.',
      'Bear isn\'t all claws all of the time. He does root for your cause for success. It\'s time to stand your ground. This may not mean to stand up against your adversaries, however. Bear knows what situations are worth the energy and which aren\'t. Your current situation isn\'t worth the amount of energy it would take to go up against it. Sometimes it takes a strong person to walk away, and you\'re needing to be that strong arm in this situation. Entertaining this drama would just leave you drained and unprepared for other important matters.',

They get to feel as great as you do when you help.',

Don\'t be embarrassed to speak up about a fair exchange of energy. You\'ll not look weak or seem like you\'re losing control, so don\'t worry. Think of how you feel about others.',

Colors change how we feel.',
      'When we feel like cocooning or protecting our energy, we often wear black, or red. Red also gives off a confident edge and indicates love and passion. Wearing it can help us embrace changes. A red tablecloth helps strike up conversation with people who are normally shy. Color can change our mood. Blue supports us in staying calm. Green aids in healing and with encouraging personal growth.',
      'Test the colors you have around you and take note of how you feel afterwards. Find out which one helps you relax, to have better instinct, to feel energetic or which one improves your concentration. The right combination is different for everyone.

You need to become consciously aware to get to the next level of life. All too often we get comfortable with our lives. We may forget our good fortunes and the need to be thankful. We get stuck in safe patterns, and programs. Our practices become habits.",

When our spiritual path is filled with praise and goodness, our physical path opens to amazing universal support and reinforcement.",

Buffalo served as food, clothing, shelter, and trade. Perhaps therefore it has earned its name as the provider and is associated with abundance.

A natural process of mourning and grieving occurs when we make major changes. If you must cocoon for a while to process, it's ok.",

      "When a raven arrives in your life, you'll know that an ancestor is visiting. They come to remind you that synchronicities are coincidences that are not coincidence. Pay attention to signs happening all around you. Look for numbers, colors, feathers, coins, animals, and birds. Your guides are constantly trying to get your attention. By getting to know the meaning of these signs it'll make communication a lot easier. Read up on their meanings, take a class or do some research. You may get your own meanings and write them in a notepad for later use.",
      "Raven is a calculated fellow. He can play many roles. He's known to be a trickster as well as a wise one. He can be a messenger of play and or work. Either way, he helps you through the difficult times in life and helps you find good in the darker moments. When he arrives in your life, you'll know that you're meant to face some hard realities so you can let go of what's not needed in life and allow good to flow in its place. Raven's motto is “go into the darkness to find the light.”",
      "Open your mind and heart to heavenly communication. Open a book and write the first five random words you flip to. Put them in a sentence or write a couple sentences to get an idea of how the words blend to create a message. Pull oracle cards. There are ways that you can make it easier for your ancestors to get their point across. Raven is there as a guide to help with that process."

      "This card may have been chosen because of your love for nature and your ability to spread teachings to others. The Sardine may be guiding you to study more on preservation and how you can help the plants and animals in the world. Learn about using less chemicals. Find out what products we use or eat that cause harm to animal habitats. Educate others about things like the palm oil industry that's taking away land from wild orangutans. “All animals are important,” says sardine.",
      "Sardine uses its own example to help others understand the importance of preservation and sustainability. Sardines are the true wealth of the ocean. They're very important for the ocean's birds, mammals and also for other fish. They're the foundation and a rich abundance for the marine food web. They're the cornucopia of the sea, especially for mammals like the whales, sharks, and other sea life, who would die out and possibly even become extinct without the sardines. It's a quick meal with less work and a privilege or liberty that's fast diminishing. For mammals like the whale, conserving its energy for long journeys ahead is vital.",
      "Sea life aren't the only ones who rely on this superabundant cornucopia. Sea inhabitants share the waters with fisherman, as well. Sardine, salmon, and tuna numbers have been largely dwindling from overreaching numbers of catches in our oceans. Where Sardines are a major food source for so many, they also represent lack, as well as abundance.",
      "Sardine comes to teach humankind that what we take from nature must be given back. If we fish all the important fish from the ocean, we'll have nothing to draw from in future generations, both for humans and sea life alike. You may be called to be an activist soon for a cause dear to your heart, concerning the care and nurturing of Mother Earth and the preservation of one or all her precious resources. "

Seagull swoops in to remind you to move where the best resources might be. Use your opportunistic skills and grab what you can while the going is good. Life is a series of seasons. This is a time when things are more abundant, and the opportunities being given aren't things that come everyday. Feed on the fish that life is offering you. Don't hold out for better conditions, in case Winter is coming. Put any extra away and save for times when things aren't so abundant.",

You may also want to fix up the house with items other people are selling at yard-sales, or at thrift stores. You could visit a scrap yard to fix the car. Take a risk and ask people if they have a certain item you need, so you don't have to waste funds.",
      "Take advantage of the resources you have in front of you and don't be wasteful. You know people well. They often hate throwing things away in case it's usable in the future.

By asking for help, you may become other people's purpose and inspiration to clean out the closet of their life."

Having control over your emotions symbolizes personal growth and maturity. Don't put yourself to the test. Not with this subject. You'll be marked harshly if you do.

You won't win coming from an emotional stance. It won't serve you to approach them upset or to react with fervour. They don't see it your way and there's a chance they never will. To each their own! Yet don't give up hope. Having expectations may end up disappointing you even more than the situation already has. Trying to fix things right now would be like adding insult to injury on both ends of the situation. Both sides are too hot headed about having their point of view being heard.",
      "For now, stay observant and perceptive without giving away what you're thinking. Let things calm down. Once you show maturity and you listen to the other side, they'll be more willing to listen to yours. By then you'll be able to approach things more diplomatically anyway. Wait until you have a clear signal that things are calmer before you react. If that signal doesn't come, then you may have to practice keeping that mouth of yours clamped shut. Otherwise, you'll be seen as the one that's authoritative, competitive and fierce. That's not your pretty side to be showing to the camera, trust me."

      "As humans, we often think we know better. However, we really can't say if we're correct or not until someone's life develops and plays out. Otherwise, we could be just forcing our expectations on them. That isn't right!",
      "Past lives may be playing a factor, also. Perhaps going for a birth chart reading or to a psychic/medium session could help shed some light on your situation and help you understand more."

A new animal may also be entering your life. Whatever the case, change is on the horizon. You're likely finding that life has been shifting so quickly around you, that you have no choice but to accept change. This is no time to allow old programs and belief systems to stand in your way. If you want to survive, you must shapeshift with the times. Allow your instincts to lead the way.",
      "By choosing this card, you're being shown that you're about to embark on a journey of self discovery like never before. Step out of the crowd and take on your own style. Do things your own way. Valor and victory are on your side. Wolf is protecting you and helping you on this life journey.",
      "Know that solitude does not mean that you're completely alone. Though you'll find yourself spending more time on your own in the next while, know that it's also a time to allow your inner voice to speak to you. You won't be so distracted because of your old ways of being. Our daily activities often numb our inner voice. We sometimes busy ourselves with gadgets and things that snuff it out. It also cancels out our intuition.",
      "Wolf offers to lend you his keen instincts. He says, “Your sixth sense will be getting stronger with each moon cycle. Let it be a guiding light in the darkest of times. For now, and for always, I am with you…”"

      "Emergency Steadiness- Jump into action. Stay relaxed under pressure. Follow your instinct. Don't try and fix it if it's not broken.",
      "The wombat reminds you to follow your gut instincts. Don't be afraid to jump into action when it comes to helping others. Just be certain they need it before you waste your energy. Be ready to make a stand for someone or to back them up. Logic and poise will be needed in this situation. There's no need to be too overly protective. Don't get all up in arms too quickly. Yes, caring for others is your instinct. Your job isn't to become the defender of the universe. It's a nice title, but it creates a dependent world. Help others feel strong and confident by helping them help themselves. The point is to allow them to feel that they can handle their situation by themselves. Designate when possible, so others feel that they have a purpose in their role to play. That will create a healthier interdependent world around you.",
      "If you're wondering about your life purpose, you may be called into duty to help others in emergency, authoritative or healing situations. You were certainly born with a mission. Your wish to heal the world is coming from a natural desire. It's not just your imagination. You were sent here for a reason, that's for certain. Just don't get too overly zestful and push others out of their positions with your desire to be superhero. Carry yourself rightfully and respectfully and you'll reach your mark without overstepping in some way.",
      "Don't get too upset, if you cannot help someone. Others may have life situations happen to them for them to learn and grow. Do what you can when you can and leave the rest. Know that sometimes just being there to listen to people is one of the greatest gifts you can offer them. Give advice only when they ask for it. You don't have to fix others since they can have a major healing on their own. Being yourself around them can help too. Live by example and be the example. How do you do that? Just be yourself. Tone down your ego. Allow people their own pride. Worry about your own. And maybe lighten up a bit!"

      "Be Different- Embrace your individuality. Use your unique ability to speak your mind. You get younger the more you play.",
      "The world needs a leader like you, especially with your eccentric personality traits. Your unique appearance is your trademark, which is sure to mesmerize onlookers. It's important that you use this gift of individuality to change the world. You show great pride in everything that you do. Zebra spirit sees your determination and your pure heart. To some you may seem individualistic, and fiercely independent. However, this does not take away from your ability to help others and to be a team player.",
      "Family and friends that gain your respect have an ally for life. If they cross you, you tend to never forget. It's important that you use your instincts to discern who's who in your life. Never doubt yourself. Your first instinct is usually the right one. Go with your own feelings over others. Also, be sure not to judge others too much for their lack of individuality. Not everyone is able to express themselves like you can.",
      "Note the good in others and give compliments more often. Don't hold back. Encourage others when you can. Your opinion really matters to people whether you realize it or not. Watch your words. Stay positive no matter what. Your steadiness may change someone's life for the good without you even realizing it.",
      "Show your playful side more often with others. Sometimes you come across as a little too serious. Play should be a major part of your day. You feel brighter and happier when you frolic with others. It helps you feel like you belong. It also makes you seem younger than you are. The more you play, the younger you'll look and feel."
