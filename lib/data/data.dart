You have lots of advice for others in how to better their lives, but you have a “do as I say, not as I do” way of approaching things. This will eventually catch up with you. This card comes as a warning to begin taking care of yourself in all ways. (Mentally, Physically, Spiritually, Emotionally). You need to have peace in your heart and know that you deserve all good things, especially self care. You feel guilty when you do things for you, this is part of the issue. Think of it this way, your loved one wishes they took better care of themselves now, but it is too late. They hope you get the lesson from their death which resulted from them not doing for themselves.',

Then Heaven can say if it is the right direction or not. Free Will is the dominant law of the universe that requires you to make choices here on Earth before anyone in the upper realms can help you out. I apologize that I did not live in a way to be a good influence that would have taught you to care for yourself more. I felt at the time that self care was selfish.

This is important. Lots of people send out wishes to the universe and then later wonder why nothing came about it. This is because they had an expectation or sent out “Give to Me” prayers without putting any human steps forward to being worthy of the gifts being bestowed upon them. There are two keys you need to access Heavenly support: sincerity and gratitude. Without these, you are taking instead of offering anything in exchange for their hard work.',

        'Non-attachment is the key to finding inner peace. While living in the physical realm we often get emotionally attached to the physical world around us, places, and things and even people. Though it is ok to have things, Heaven reminds us that the world is temporary, and our true wealth is the connection we make to the soul parts of ourselves. We are spiritual beings, as well as physical beings. It is important that we leave the world sustainable, and not just take without replacing what we took. We must also give or add to the world. Otherwise, we cause ourselves karma and we will struggle in our future lives and not have enough. This is one of the first lessons we learn on the other side when we transition. This is also connected to “letting go”. First, we release the body and then we deal with the physical items and people we left behind. We come to an understanding that we are all connected, no matter what we have or do not have. Attachment to items is often what keeps us from knowing ourselves from the inside.',
        "Now I see it from a different perspective. While on Earth we never really own anything or anyone. We like to think that we do, but we do not. When I died, I left it all behind. I was taught that we only borrow a body suit that lives in our world so that we can learn and grow. I learned; less is more. Living with fewer things means that there is less to juggle or maintain. Let go or give away what is not serving you and make way for the new. Do not hold onto things that are just sitting around and not ever being used. If you have not worn it for two years, then it is likely that you will not wear it two years from now. Let it go. I held onto things for too long in life, now I feel light and free without things. There is nothing I must maintain or pay for or compare myself to. I am unburdened and liberated. You can do the same on Earth to a certain extent. The less you have, the more value you will see in what you do have."

You have the choice in your life to be happy, mad, glad, or sad. Free Will allows you to make your own choices and so Heaven cannot choose for you. It would be a whole lot easier if you would ask your spiritual team to help you make choices that are good for you. Firstly, you must accept that you are worthy of Heaven’s help. See yourself as they do; a loving, caring, gentle, unlimited being that is worthy of unconditional love.',
        'Sometimes I wish I could go back in the body and embrace the fullness of my spirit from the human perspective. I would look at my story differently. I would have celebrated my accomplishments a lot longer if I knew then what I know now. I would have also appreciated my imperfections. Everything happened for a reason, and it all made me who I was and who I still am. Now I can see that it was all perfection, especially in Heaven’s eyes.

Be clear in your words and actions. Set yourself up in a way that you are always respected and treated with respect. Trying to change other people’s actions or how they think, does not really change them, it just changes their circumstances but not their behaviours. Their situations will always go back to the way they lived before. Encourage others instead to make their own decisions, to make lasting changes in their lives. Enough shifting who you are to make others happy. Be yourself no matter what. Walk away or let others walk away when things do not flow properly. Life is not meant to be a struggle. We are meant to take responsible for our own thoughts and actions and to allow others to do the same.',
        'I had a hard time with boundaries when I was on Earth too. Either I could not set them with others, or I crossed other people’s boundaries without realizing it. It is easier to see now what I could have changed but I know what it feels like to be in human form and not be able to see a clear path. What I can suggest now is to take a step back from your situation and look at it from outside the circle. Do not waste precious gifts like trust, respect, or love. Learn to let people earn it from you and vice versa. Recognize when enough is enough. Accept that some things are not meant for ‘forever’. Do not just keep giving away chances to someone who is not trying to show an effort. If they keep making the same mistakes and do not ever seem to learn or want to learn from life circumstances, be done with it and move on. That is my advice from my new Heavenly perspective.'

        'Your deceased loved one would like to remind you to discover a pursuit that brings purpose to your life. What do you love to do that makes you feel free yet challenged? Hard life situations often get us down. When you wonder what you can do to find purpose, sometimes taking time away from problems for a while will help. By doing something that brings you purpose, it also frees your mind so that you can find meaning and purpose in the issues at hand as well. For instance, if someone dies, and you love sewing, then maybe making a blanket or pillows from their clothing could help you get your mind off things but also find meaning and purpose at the same time. The faster you find meaning and purpose in hard situations, the easier life is. The longer you wait, the longer you carry the pain deep within.',
        'There are many things you can be doing to keep busy and to feel better. The longer you sit around and mope the deeper you could fall out of grace and into a depression. Depression is the absence of light, the absence of envisioning that you will ever be cheerful or happy again. It engulfs you and sucks the life force energy out of you. I know this because I went through my own bouts of depression when I was on Earth. It is something I did not talk about with others. Do not allow yourself to dwell too long in the absence of hope. Sadness is normal, but it is when that sadness takes you to a deep cave that you cannot escape that it becomes too much. I am not saying do not feel. Feeling is natural. Undealt with depression is not healthy is all I am saying. Promise me that when you get like this, you will call someone and plan to get out and enjoy yourself. When you feel joy, that is where you will feel me the most. Depression blocks me from being near you. Please understand this.'

Replaying an emotion or situation and reviewing and reliving your mistakes repeatedly in your head only keeps you hostage to the past. Living in exile because of the past cuts you off from the potential of the future. It is important to understand that we are only guilty when we know better and do it anyway. If you did things in the past without realizing it was wrong, then it was not a mistake, it was an unfortunate happening or choice that you learned from. Forgive yourself for not knowing better at the time. Past behaviours, patterns and traits that have been corrected, shifted, and transformed are meant to be left in the past.',
        'I am here to help your soul heal and elevate itself past the pain, past the hurt and to transform all that has happened. It is time to surrender and let go of what does not serve your spirit in a good way. Clear old trauma from the body by using natural items to pull off any old stuck on energy from past events. Protect your energy field. Get the lessons by mastering your mind and your emotions. Honour your body as a temple. Forgive yourself and love yourself unconditionally. When you do, you will thrive and vibrate at a higher level. This newfound frequency will draw in higher vibrational situations and people to you. Elevate yourself from who you were in the past.

This will not only help calm you, but it will also help you feel their loving energy more strongly. Staying hydrated can also help alleviate anxieties and help bring down stress levels. You can go to a river or to the ocean, listen to the soothing sound of a fountain, or simply take a bath. Make sure you drink plenty of water daily. Your loved one knows that humans are naturally drawn to water because it provides many health benefits. Your loved one wants you to have an improved sense of physical health and well being. Water has many health benefits; hydration, better skin, better digestion and metabolism, better mood, less headaches, and it can help you concentrate longer.',
        'We can connect through telepathy. Take time to breath in fresh air. Allow your mind to calm into a meditative state. This will help you move out of the ego mind and into a state of awareness and connection with the higher self. That is when I can deliver messages to you. Expect communications to be short and sweet. I will not always be able to repeat messages, so pay attention when it comes. Keep a journal handy to record messages that I bring to you. When we are aligned with the same goal it will be easier for me to come through to you. Like a radio broadcast, you need to be on the same frequency or station that I am on, to hear what I am saying to you. When you go near water, I tune into that serene atmosphere and I can bring visual signs, like ducks, swans and such or I am able to come through sound, like wind, water, or fluttering wings. I can come as my own voice. If you are still enough and tuned into that frequency you will catch these signs easily.'

It is a sure sign that something is being clearly confirmed. Goosebumps may occur when you are asking for a yes or no answer. It is a tool, used as an affirmative from Heaven, telling you that yes, what you were thinking was true. It may be time to make changes in your life. It may be time to go for your dreams. In fact, whatever gives you goosebumps is what you should go for in life. Heaven loves to use your senses to speak to you. You may also feel, see, hear, know, and smell with your senses to get your answers from Heaven.",

This is exactly the feeling you’ll get from the goosebumps I am sending you. I enjoy helping you clear up your yes’ and no’s so you can make good decisions. You will sometimes go seemingly wrong directions no matter what. Some things are just meant to happen. Know that all roads lead home. I hope you won’t hold back and that you’ll experience it all, letting life move your heart.

All, so that we do not take it with us energetically when we cross over to the other side, Heaven. Once we are free of karma, then we can begin helping others on Earth to do the same, releasing their karmic ties or karmic relationships. Many deceased Loved ones help us from above. They help us come to a place of understanding so that we may see from a higher perspective. When we see clearly, we are more apt to stay on track and have a greater opportunity to manifest our true Divine Purpose.

There were also things that happened that I could have changed, shifted, or controlled and I did not. Now I have the wisdom to know the difference. I admit it is a lot easy when you can see things from the outside perspective and when you are not in the middle of the emotions surrounding the situation. If I could see and know back then what I know now, I would have lived my life differently. I take responsibility for those choices now. What I did not know back then, I forgave myself for. Now that I know better, I am gaining trust in myself so that next time I go back to Earth, I do not make the same mistakes.

I can see now that hard life choices are great growth opportunities. This is a good time to take note of your old way of handling situations and how those actions put you right back into the same circumstances. Do not go that direction. Look for new avenues. Study about human behaviour and read a bit on self-help. You have some obvious dysfunctional behaviours to get a handle on. These codependent relationships you keep entertaining are a result of it.

Make sure to stay balanced in all areas regarding your health. Get regular check ups and monitor your stress levels. You have a mission on Earth still. Heaven is not ready for you just yet. So, make the best of it and take care of your health, will you?",

Once I sent a feather to the ground and you were looking up at the sky instead of looking down at your feet. It is all just a matter of hit and miss sometimes. Let me know when you are ready to tune in and tell me what you are going to focus on, and I will work around you and within the intuition channel that you are tapped into."

Do I stick with them?” You know who respects you because when you are no longer a benefit to their life, they still see value in having you around. What you put out into the Universe is what comes back to you, and so when you respect yourself, others will respect you back. If you do not value yourself then you will be attracted to those that do not see your value. Or you will stop seeing value in others.",

As people died before me, I learned about regret. There were things I did not appreciate about them until they were gone. So, I get it. I know you see me now for who I really am and why I did the things I did in life. I realize now that I lowered my standards for others.

You act like you know everything and then when the time comes to show your talents you refuse to deliver unless you can do a perfect job. Other times you act like you do not know anything and look to be saved or rescued. This is victim mentality. Intention is likely the issue here. You start off thinking you are doing things right, but your approach is a little to cocky by times. When you do that then next time you are scared. It is a set up against yourself every time to act like that. You sometimes take things out of another’s hands to be the hero, and this causes them to feel weak. Other times you ask others for help and expect them to bail you out. You need to be working on interdependence?

Now that I am independent, and I can trust myself I am able to rely on the angels and they can equally rely on me. That is interdependence. I have not expected them to do things for me, we are doing them together as one unit. For example, we work together to bring you messages that can help you help yourself. This is what I am doing for you. I am holding my space and seeing you through your situation. As you gain true independence then I will continue to walk beside you and together we can do great things without ever losing ourselves to one another.

The key to learning a lesson is that when you learned it, then it is supposed to be finished, and behind you. You are being told to stop apologizing and to be yourself no matter how it affects or upsets others. It is the others that are choosing to live a lie, not you. When you stop arguing, there is no argument to be had. Step out of being guilted and there is nothing to fear. Being your true self will encourage others who are also pushed aside to be themselves.

Respect yourself enough to make room for it in your life. Buddha once said, “You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve love and affection.” Taking time out is you offering love to yourself. Like the Buddha, take time sitting by a tree and allowing yourself to release your fears and worries up to the universe. Ask for Buddha to sit with you and to help you set goals that will get you on track. Time out allows fresh new ideas to spark you up again. Get into a new zone, by giving yourself room to grow and by allowing the old to be released and the new to come in.",

Now they are combing through those time periods and rounding out the lessons they had. Once they get through them, they will be able to think on a deeper level.
